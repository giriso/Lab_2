Imagine Dragons - Demons

Chorus 1:

When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold
 
When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale
 
I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide
 
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

Verse:
 
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
